# Production Repo

This repository contains a production ready version of previous code. Rather than disparate Jupyter notebooks, the previous code has been refactored into a single python file. Simply run the "build_model.py" file from the command line, and it will automatically ingest all of the data from the "data" folder, clean it, train a model with it, and persist the model to the "model.pickle" file.
